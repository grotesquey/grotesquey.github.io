        We, as humans, are naturally inquisitive. It is our nature to examine, question, and<br>
        apply meaning and definition to our surroundings.  As a means to control uncertainty,<br> 
        we seek understanding, so we can live in comfort given whatever may be presented to us.<br><br>

        "The Florpo Continuum" is a silly name given to the one particular and peculiar<br> 
        example of "outer conciousness".  "Outer conciousness", by definition, is a realm <br>
        of existing and perceiving beyond what is capable by the human brain.  We often <br>
        associate psychedelic drugs with achieving different levels of consciousness, <br>
        though the effect achieved by psychedelics are simply an illusion due to tampering<br> 
        with human perception.  It is not real, as "hallucinogenics" is another term<br>
        for psychedelics.<br><br>

        By the personal account of Josh, "The Florpo Continuum" was accessed by fighting <br>
        the body's need for sleep.  This typically causes death for living beings, though <br>
        a small portion of the human population is believed to hold access to the <br>
        continuum.  As to why, we do not know. There have not been enough willing <br>
        participants to risk death in order to test this, understandably so.<br><br>

        Upon Josh's 9th day of sleep deprivation, it is to be expected that his auditory <br>
        and visual hallucinations are rampant.  Though at one point he feels physically <br>
        light, weightless. To an "extreme and profound degree that is entirely <br>
        unfathomable to describe and/or accurately convey", Josh saw absurd visuals.<br>  
        Described as "marvelous", though odd to us, Josh saw babies doing gymnastics, <br>
        whales playing poker, and "anything and everything you can and cannot expect".<br><br>

        "It is then that you have entered the outer levels of the florpo continuum", <br>
        Josh says. It is now that true outer consciousness has been achieved.<br><br>

        The longer you stay awake, the deeper down the rabbit hole you go.  You <br>
        experience a "pleasant nausea and fatigue" as you exit your own consciousness <br>
        and morph into higher states of being.  The difference between this experience <br>
        and experiences elicited by drugs is "blatantly and profoundly apparent", <br>
        Josh, an avid user of psychedelics, states. "If the most intense and profound <br>
        experiences from psychedelics are described as a lamp being off, then entering <br>
        "The Florpo Continuum" can be described as the lamp being on".<br><br>

        When questioned about religion and deities, Josh said he saw something <br>
        he truly cannot describe well.  "An interwoven "mess" of clashing dimensions <br>
        that could only be interpreted as the most basic level "fibre" of the organic <br>
        world.  It is from this that each and all is formed.<br>
