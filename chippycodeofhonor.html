        1) A Chippy is the most supple type of being. He is to be pious, and care for his <br>
        fellow kin with the utmost warmth.<br><br>



        2) In order to qualify for the Rash Gash Bloody Chippy Info Zine Club, you have to <br>
        possess a semi-mythical strain of DNA called the "Gastric 457" gene. It is found <br>
        in only 1 in 7080 adult men past the age of 35, but it is rapidly declining in <br>
        ubiquity. This gene not only makes it possible for Chippies to lactate, but it <br>
        also bears responsibility for the euphoria which fills the minds of Chippies across <br>
        the nation.<br><br>
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
        3) In the summer of 1958, Senator Ranald Aclaffe of Kenstripton, Marchusset <br>
        established the first Chippy Roundtable at his local shriners auditorium. In <br>
        addition to coining the infamous proverb of Gonjamonj, he shed light on <br>
        Chippies as less of an underground phenomena and more of a cult-like sense of <br>
        existence. In other words, he allowed insecure men to finally be themselves, <br>
        and embrace the Chippy stronghold.<br><br>
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
        4) The term Chippy is derived from Sudanese "Shi Peh," meaning to make larger <br>
        by means of engorgement. The word faded into obscurity until the early 1910s, <br>
        when the now lost silent film "Darnell Jacob Enters A Patstrip" was released <br>
        under Universal. The film contained a character named "Chippe Tensteak," who <br>
        was portrayed as flabby yet blissfully ignant. Tensteak went on to become a <br>
        household name in the world of cinema, despite the film's lack of availability.<br><br>
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
        5) There are three classes of Chippy existence, as defined by Prof. Bart <br>
        Weegee from New York Tech. The first one is "Diet Coke Fip," which is titled <br>
        after the low-tier Chippy's affinity for diet coke. A class two Chippytype <br>
        is also known as a "Peniskin." These Chippies are highly contagious, as <br>
        they all have butt cancer. That's yucky. The third Chippytype is <br>
        BespyWhespychan, and it is named after the whispy nature of the Chippy's <br>
        tits and testicles.<br>
